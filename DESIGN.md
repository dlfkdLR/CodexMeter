# Design System: CodexMeter

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Quiet Instrument"**

CodexMeter should feel like a compact macOS instrument that is ready when opened and disappears when the user returns to work. It is precise, calm, and native: the first screen answers the immediate questions, while charts, projects, sessions, and full limit details remain one click deeper.

The product uses system materials, semantic labels, SF Symbols, hairline separators, and tabular numerals instead of decorative dashboard chrome. Density is intentional, but every section must have one clear purpose and retain enough spacing to scan quickly.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Native macOS controls and semantic system styling.
- Token totals remain the strongest visual signal.
- Progressive disclosure instead of one long provider dashboard.
- Quiet status communication with explicit text for warnings and estimates.
- Motion explains change and never blocks interaction.

## Two surfaces since 2.0

Through 1.x the whole product was a `MenuBarExtra` popover with a diamond
meter. 2.0 splits it in two, and they follow **different** visual systems on
purpose:

- **The edge notch** — a floating usage ring per provider welded to a screen
  edge, ported from the MIT-licensed [Codenotch](https://github.com/vinzdg/codenotch).
  It keeps Codenotch's design language, which is not this one: a pure-black
  ground (`NotchPalette.notch`), its own green/amber/red usage bands, its own
  motion vocab (`NotchMotion`), sampled from Codenotch's design frames rather
  than macOS materials. It lives in `Sources/CodexMeter/Notch/` and is
  deliberately sealed off from the tokens below — see `NotchDesign.swift`. "똑같이"
  (make it the same as Codenotch) was the brief, and it won.
- **The Settings window** — General, Usage, Notch, Diagnostics, Information, and
  a pane per provider. This is where the Quiet Instrument rules below still
  apply. The **Usage** pane hosts the former popover (`MenuPopoverView`) in
  `embedded` mode; everything in *Components* below describes it, now reached
  from Settings rather than the menu bar.

A minimal `NSStatusItem` (`StatusItemController`) is the way back in when the
notch is hidden: Show Notch, Usage…, Settings…, Check for Updates…, Quit.

## Colors

The palette follows macOS semantic colors so it remains correct in light, dark, increased-contrast, and accent-color configurations.

### Primary

- **System Accent:** Used for healthy progress and the current macOS selection accent. Its exact color belongs to the user's system configuration.

### Secondary

- **Warning Orange:** Used only when remaining quota is low or pace is above an even-use schedule.
- **Critical Red:** Used only when remaining quota is critical.

### Neutral

- **System Background:** The popover and destination surfaces use the platform background.
- **Primary, Secondary, Tertiary Labels:** Information hierarchy comes from semantic label roles rather than fixed gray values.
- **Quaternary Fill:** Detail cards use a restrained tonal fill, with dividers separating major overview sections.

**The Semantic Color Rule.** Do not replace native semantic colors with fixed light- or dark-mode values.

**The Text-With-Color Rule.** Warning and critical colors always appear with an explicit label such as “Low” or “Critical.”

## Typography

**Display Font:** SF Pro Rounded for the primary token total.
**Body Font:** The macOS system font through SwiftUI semantic text styles.
**Label/Mono Font:** Monospaced digits for token counts, percentages, and cost values.

**Character:** The hierarchy is compact and factual. The rounded headline gives the primary metric a recognizable but restrained identity; all supporting text follows native semantic sizing and Dynamic Type.

### Hierarchy

- **Primary Metric** (semibold, 32px): Today's total and the strongest number on the overview.
- **Headline** (semantic headline): Product title and primary empty-state messages.
- **Section Label** (semibold subheadline): Limits and analytic section headings.
- **Heading Tone:** Use the category's natural capitalization, not forced uppercase. The interface stays calm without weakening hierarchy.
- **Body Row** (semantic subheadline): Token components and period totals.
- **Supporting Label** (caption and caption2): Reset times, pace, data status, and explanatory text.

**The Number Stability Rule.** Use monospaced digits and numeric content transitions anywhere changing values could shift the layout.

## Layout

The Usage pane hosts the embedded popover, a fixed compact column (372px) with content-driven height. It opens directly with enabled provider selection rather than repeating the app name and mark, and the footer keeps primary actions visible. Token Usage contains token totals, period history, and analytic destinations; the selected provider's Limits mode contains quota windows and reset timing. The selected mode expands to its full intrinsic height without an embedded scroll region, so every item remains visible at once. Major sections use dividers; details use the same width so navigation never causes a horizontal jump.

The spacing rhythm is 4px for tightly related icon-label pairs, 8px for rows, 12px between components inside a section, 16px for detailed-screen content, and 18px at popover edges. Token Usage prioritizes today's local usage, nearby periods, and analytic shortcuts; Codex Limits prioritizes quota remaining and reset timing.

**The One-Question Rule.** Each destination answers one question: limits, usage, projects, or sessions.

**The Real-Provider Rule.** Token Usage is the cross-source token summary. A named provider limits tab appears only when that provider has working data and status handling; empty provider tabs are not navigation.

## Elevation & Depth

CodexMeter is flat by default. Depth comes from the native Settings window, semantic tonal fills in detail cards, dividers, and selection state—not decorative shadows, gradients, or glass effects added by the app.

**The Flat-By-Default Rule.** Use tonal grouping and system materials before introducing custom elevation.

## Shapes

The diamond meter mark (`◈`) was the menu-bar and app identity through 1.x and is retained only as a wordmark accent — the menu bar it filled was removed in 2.0, and the live reading is now the notch's ring. The `StatusItemController` icon is a plain SF Symbol `diamond`, a nod to it. Detail selections use gently rounded 8px containers, while information cards use 10px corners. Standard buttons, progress views, menus, and navigation controls retain native macOS shapes.

**The Native Control Rule.** In the Settings window, do not redraw a platform control solely to mimic another app. (The notch is the deliberate exception — it is Codenotch's language, not this one.)

## Components

### Overview Popover

- **Character:** A compact status instrument, not a miniature dashboard.
- **Shape:** Fixed 372px width with a stable header and footer.
- **Behavior:** The selected mode uses its intrinsic height; the overview contains no nested scrolling surface.

### Top-Level Modes

- **Token Usage:** Local and optional account-wide token totals, period history, and analytic destinations.
- **Provider Limits:** Read-only Codex or Claude quota windows, reset timing, and pace. Reset-credit availability remains Codex-only.
- **Behavior:** Two equal-width native buttons switch content in place. The selected mode uses the system accent and both modes remain keyboard and VoiceOver accessible.
- **Feedback:** Clickable rows and utility buttons use a subtle neutral hover/pressed fill and an accent keyboard-focus outline. Feedback never changes geometry, honors Increase Contrast, and skips its short fade under Reduce Motion.
- **Separation:** The header contains no provider status card, connection badge, or generated explanatory subtitle.

### Primary Token Summary

- **Character:** Immediate and auditable.
- **Content:** Total first, then Input, Cached input, and Output; help text explains that cached input is included in Input and Total equals Input plus Output.
- **Motion:** Numeric transitions use a short 0.2–0.24 second ease-out and are removed when Reduce Motion is enabled.

### Account Limit Preview

- **Character:** Actionable without pretending to be a billing dashboard.
- **Order:** Pin the primary Codex Weekly window first in both the preview and Limits detail. Keep the remaining windows ordered by duration and name; do not change reported values or synthesize a missing Weekly window.
- **Content:** At most three limit windows, percent remaining, and reset countdown. Additional windows and even-use pace remain in Limits detail. Do not repeat the number of visible windows in the heading.
- **State:** Healthy uses the system accent; low and critical states combine color with text.
- **Disclosure:** Projected run-out appears only in the detailed Limits screen and is labeled as an estimate.

### Analytic Shortcuts

- **Character:** Three equal one-click destinations for Usage, Projects, and Sessions.
- **Shape:** Each target is at least 42px high with an SF Symbol and visible label.
- **Behavior:** Hidden preferences remove their destination instead of leaving disabled placeholders.

### Analytics Details

- **Shape:** All destinations keep the 372pt popover width. Short content determines its own height; longer analytics scroll within a 440pt viewport, while other long details cap their viewport at 520pt.
- **Structure:** A 44pt header owns the back button and title in the same vertical layout as the content. Do not embed `NavigationStack` or an automatic window toolbar; a second navigation/safe-area owner can leave a large gap above the filters.
- **Position:** Native range and metric controls keep intrinsic height directly below the title, with 12pt vertical padding. Only the chart or list scrolls, anchored at the top; filters never absorb surplus height.
- **Navigation:** Back returns to the previous destination and preserves its range, metric, and selected chart day. Command-[ also goes back.
- **Reading Order:** Align the name and token total on the first row; dates, session counts, and estimated costs are secondary below. Full truncated names remain available as help text. Detail totals use the same rounded, tabular type as the overview at a smaller 28pt size.
- **Concise Copy:** State today's period and source once above its total. Omit generic headings above self-explanatory navigation rows. Unknown cost messages appear in the summary or item detail, not on every project, model, and session row; unavailable estimates must never become zero. Keep API estimates visibly labeled. Long limit explanations are collapsed under “About these limits”; reset timestamps and image-count methodology use contextual help. Source dates, stale/error messages, and low-limit warnings stay visible.
- **Charts:** Rounded bar ends and the system accent match the rest of the app; do not hard-code a blue gradient.
- **Verification:** Render the production `MenuPopoverView`, including its actual header and destination, with loading, empty, and populated content. Assert title-to-filter spacing and viewport bounds, and verify the viewport shrinks and grows with content instead of testing a substitute navigation host.

### Footer Actions

- **Character:** Stable utility actions with 28px targets.
- **Behavior:** Refresh rotates once while starting and respects Reduce Motion; Settings and More remain fixed. More groups status, repository, update, and quit actions.
- **Keyboard:** Refresh uses Command-R, Settings uses Command-comma, and Quit uses Command-Q.

### Detail Cards

- **Character:** Quiet tonal containers for limit, selection, and breakdown details.
- **Shape:** 10px corners with 12px padding; selected chart details use 8px corners.
- **Background:** Quaternary semantic fill at low opacity.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** keep Token Usage focused on token totals and history, and Codex Limits focused on account limits and reset timing.
- **Do** use semantic system colors, SwiftUI text styles, SF Symbols, VoiceOver labels, keyboard shortcuts, and Reduce Motion.
- **Do** show unknown or incomplete cost data as unavailable in detailed analytics instead of zero.
- **Do** keep local token totals, account-wide profile totals, quota percentages, and API-equivalent estimates visibly distinct.
- **Do** add Claude, Gemini, or another provider behind a shared provider boundary before exposing it in navigation.

### Don't:

- **Don't** copy CodexBar branding or assets; reuse only mode separation and information-architecture ideas that improve scanning for CodexMeter's real features.
- **Don't** place charts, projects, sessions, credits, every provider, and every limit on the overview.
- **Don't** show empty or speculative provider tabs.
- **Don't** use purple/blue AI gradients, neon, decorative glass, giant cards, or custom dashboard chrome.
- **Don't** communicate low quota, stale data, or estimates through color alone.
